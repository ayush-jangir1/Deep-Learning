**🧠 Deep Learning Playground**

Where neurons fire, weights adjust, and overfitting is just a phase.

_This repository is dedicated to exploring the intricacies of neural networks. It serves as an open diary of experiments, from fundamental concepts to advanced architectures._

**🧩 What’s Inside?**

**Beginner to Intermediate**

    BERT Text Classification
    Fine-tuning a pretrained BERT model for text classification tasks.

**Grad-CAM**

    Visualizing Neural Network Decisions
    Understand what your CNN "sees" using Grad-CAM heatmaps.
    gradcam-cnn.ipynb

**Image Reconstruction with Autoencoders**

    Unsupervised learning using autoencoders to reconstruct input images.

**🔵 Advanced**

**Vision Transformer (ViT) Classification**

    Applying transformer-based architectures to image classification.

**Remember:** behind every great neural net is a human who Googled “why my model accuracy stuck at 50%” at least once.

**Thanks for stopping by, and may your weights always converge!**

**🚧 In Progress & Coming Soon -** This repository is actively maintained and expanded. More experiments are on the way — including explorations into GANs, self-supervised learning, model interpretability, and performance tuning techniques.

**P.S.** – Okay, you caught me — I had a little help from ChatGPT writing this😅. But hey, it takes a neural network to truly understand the struggles, dreams, and existential dread of another neural network. Think of it as AI helping me decode AI — poetic, right? 😄😄😄😄
